# Currency Converter API

This project is a simple **Currency Converter** built using Flask and an API to fetch real-time exchange rates. It allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another based on current exchange rates.

## Features

- Convert an amount of money from one currency to another.
- Real-time exchange rates from an external API.
- Easy-to-use web interface to input the amount and select the currencies.
- Supports multiple currencies including USD, EUR, GBP, etc.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask** - A lightweight Python web framework.
- **Requests** - Python library for making HTTP requests.
- **API** - Currency data fetched from a free exchange rate API.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codestantceasar/Playing-Around-with-APIs.git
```

### 2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd Playing-Around-with-APIs
```

### 3. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 4. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 5. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open a browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
   You should see the Currency Converter app running.

3. **Make a conversion**:
   - Enter the amount you want to convert.
   - Choose the currency you are converting from and to.
   - The result will be displayed on the same page.

## Example API Request

You can also use the API directly by making GET requests to:
```
/convert?amount=<amount>&from_currency=<from_currency>&to_currency=<to_currency>
```

For example:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/convert?amount=100&from_currency=USD&to_currency=EUR
```

This will convert 100 USD to EUR.
